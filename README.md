Work in Progress

A chrome extension for https://genshin-center.com/planner that allows users to add artifacts and set their stats.

Artifact icons (src/js/dataset.json) are originally from https://impact.moe/ using their API but later converted to .PNG and uploaded to imgur.com for faster loading times (original 256x256 .wepb images loaded quite slowly).



## Plans, maybe?
[ ] export to / import from a text file
[ ] option to remove all artifacts from all characters
[ ] Show artifacts-checkbox to the Options menu
